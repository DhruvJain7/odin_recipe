        Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>Cornmeal for baking sheet</li>
        <li>Flour for surface</li>
        <li>1 lb. pizza dough (thawed, if frozen)</li>
        <li>3/4 c. marinara sauce</li>
        <li>3 oz. mozzarella cheese, coarsely grated</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. grated parmesan</li>
        <li>Basil, for sprinkling</li>
       </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>If you have one, place a pizza stone in the oven and heat oven to 500ºF (if you can’t heat oven this high without broiling, set to 475ºF). Dust a baking sheet with cornmeal.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>On a lightly floured surface, shape pizza dough into a 14- to 16-in oval or circle and place on prepared sheet (make sure that the dough slides easily around the sheet, if not, add a bit more cornmeal).  </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>
                Step 3
            </h3>
            <p>
                Spread sauce on dough, leaving a ½-in boarder all the way around and sprinkle with mozzarella and then Parmesan. If using a stone, slide the pizza off the sheet onto the stone. Bake until crust is golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with basil just before serving, if desired.

       </ol>
